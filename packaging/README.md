# ThirdAI Platform Driver Script

This repository contains a script, `driver.sh`, which automates the deployment of the ThirdAI platform using Ansible. This document provides instructions on how to use the script and what it does.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following are installed on your machine:

1. **Ansible**: The script automatically installs Ansible if it's not already installed.
2. **Bash**: Ensure you have a Bash shell environment available to run the script.
3. **Configuration File**: A `config.yml` file is required to provide necessary configurations for the Ansible playbooks.

## Files in the Package

- `driver.sh`: The main script to automate the deployment.
- `config.yml`: The configuration file required for Ansible to deploy the platform.
- `models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-f16.gguf`: The generation model used by the platform.
- `platform`: This contains Ansible playbooks and other necessary files.

## How to Run `driver.sh`

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download and Extract the Package**:
   
   After downloading the `thirdai-platform-package.tar.gz`, extract it:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p my_folder
   tar -xzvf thirdai-platform-package.tar.gz -C my_folder
   ```

   This will extract the following files and directories:
   - `driver.sh`
   - `config.yml`
   - `platform/`
   - `models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-f16.gguf`

3. **Run the Script**:
   
   The `driver.sh` script requires the path to a `config.yml` file as an argument. You can use the default `config.yml` provided in the package or supply your own configuration file.

   To run the script with the default configuration:

   ```bash
   ./driver.sh ./config.yml
   ```
### Instruction to migrating to a different public IP/DNS

When changing the public IP of your Cluster, follow these steps to update the settings and ensure proper functionality:

4. **Steps to Update Frontend URL**

   - To access the admin console, follow these steps:

      1. **Set up Port Forwarding**  
         Open a terminal on your local machine and run the following command:  
         ```bash
         sudo ssh -i <public-key> -L 443:<PRIVATE_IP_OF_MACHINE>:443 <USERNAME>@<NEW_PUBLIC_IP>
         ```  

      2. **Access the Admin Console**  
         Once port forwarding is successfully set up, open your browser on the local machine and navigate to:  
         ```  
         https://localhost/keycloak/admin/master/console/  
         ```  

         You should now be redirected to the admin console.

   - In the **Keycloak Admin Console**, go to:
      - Select the realm: `Thirdai-Platform`.
      - Navigate to **Realm Settings â†’ General**.

   - Update the **Frontend URL** to:
     ```
     https://{newPublicIP}/keycloak
     ```
   - Ensure the new public URL corresponds to the domain name specified for the SSL certificate.
   - If the domain does not match the new URL, you will need to provide an updated certificate for the new domain/IP.
   - If you dont have the access to older admin console, then you may need to do change the env var `KC_HOSTNAME` and `KC_HOSTNAME_ADMIN` to new public IP in the Keycloak Job, restart it before seeing the change. 


5. **What Happens During Execution**:
   
   - The script checks for the installation of Ansible. If Ansible is not installed, the script will install it automatically.
   - The script verifies if the model folder (`gen-ai-models/`) is present. If the folder is not found, the script issues a warning but proceeds with the playbook execution.
   - The script searches for a `docker_images` folder and warns if it's not found, but proceeds with the playbook execution.
   - The script then navigates to the `platform/` directory and runs the `test_deploy.yml` Ansible playbook using the provided `config.yml`, the model path, the Docker images path as extra variables.

### Example Command

#### Running the script
```bash
./driver.sh ./config.yml
```

### Adding new nodes in the cluster

   New node(s) can also be added afterward as well.
   
   - Fill the configuration file `new_client_config.yml` present in `platform/` directory similar to `./config.yml`.
   - Run the script with onboarding option:
      ```bash
         ./driver.sh ./config --onboard_clients
      ```
   - When prompted, enter the absolute path to the `new_client_config.yml` file.
   - Make sure to update the `nodes` attribute of the `config.yml` with the new nodes present in `new_client_config.yml` to enable the addition of `nodes` again. 

### Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: If you encounter a "permission denied" error while running the script, ensure that the script has executable permissions by running the `chmod +x driver.sh` command. If you are using a `.pem` key for SSH, make sure the key file's permission is set to `400` by running `chmod 400 your-key.pem`.
- **Config File Not Found**: Ensure that the path to the `config.yml` file is correct and that the file exists at the specified location.
- **Ansible Errors**: If Ansible encounters errors during execution, review the output carefully. Ensure that your system has internet access for package installation and model downloading.
