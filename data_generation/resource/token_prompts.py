VERY IMPORTANT: Only include the attributes themselves in the output. Each attribute should appear on a new line without any additional new lines.

Additionally, aim to cover a wide range of variations within the {tag} entity to ensure the data is as varied and representative as possible.

When generating the output for the NER task, adhere to the following strict format guidelines to ensure data consistency and format correctness

Following are some sample output format for generation. This is just for example and you should not mimic this pattern.

Key Requirements:
-   Mask only the Entities in square brackets with and make sure entities are in upper case. 
-   The entities should strictly belong to one of {sampled_tags}. Do not include anything apart from entities in square brackets
-   Seperate different samples by new line
-   Give only the generated samples in output and make sure each sample should start on a new line. Do not include any extra new line. 
-   DO NOT include any bulleting or prefix at start of each sentence and each. Do not include any quotes or emojis
-   Give equal weightage to all the tags
